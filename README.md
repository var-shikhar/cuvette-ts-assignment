## Overview

The backend of this system handles job application management, including creation, retrieval, updating (such as changing the application status), and deletion of applications. It ensures seamless communication between the frontend and the database, while also maintaining detailed error logs for easier debugging.

## Features

### Job Application Management

- Create, update, and delete job applications.

### Logging System

- Logs errors and stores them in a designated folder for debugging.
- Ensures better tracking of backend issues.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**
- **React-Bootstarp**

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (Database)

### Additional Tools

- **Winston** (for logging errors)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the backend locally:

```sh
